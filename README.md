This is just a repository of things I think should be public.
99% of all PHP related posts are going to be tested in 7.2+, if it doesn't work in a lower version, make an issue, I'll see about making a compattible version.

### [License Key generator](./PHP/Licensekey.php)
> [Tested through 5.4.0-7.4.7](https://3v4l.org/T0pvE)

This was made because if I'm to be brutally honest, I was upset at seeing on [CodeCanyon](https://codecanyon.net/) scripts to generate license keys / serial numbers, charging from $6-$9 for a 5min tops script.
Example output [.txt](./Examples/Licensekey.txt) | [.php](Examples/Licensekey.php) 
- generate :: generates key
```php
    /**
     * % or * = Alphanumeric
     * ? = Alphabet
     * # = Numeric
     *
     * If it returns anything except a regular string, I may of done a mess up, make an issue!
     *
     * @param string $format
     * @param bool $capital
     * @return string
     */
```
- generateBulk :: calls **generate** and puts results into a string array that is returned to caller
```php
    /**
     * Returns an array of keys generated by the generate function
     *
     * @param string $format
     * @param bool $capital
     * @param int $howMany
     * @return string[]
     */
```
